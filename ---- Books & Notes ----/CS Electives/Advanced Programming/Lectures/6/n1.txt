Imperative coding: Each and every thing explained (done so far)
Declarative/Functional coding: Focus on result
Mutation: program state changes, difficult to tell where mutation occurs
Declarative code => prevent mutation
    Conversion to Declarative:
        1. Convert let's to const's
        2. Put maximum individual tasks in functions, make arrow functions
        3. Pure functions, pass arguments, don't communicate with outer world
        4. Remove looping and use javascript e6 features  e.g.reduce, find, map, filter
