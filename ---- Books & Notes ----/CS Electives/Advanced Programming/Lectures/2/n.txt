javascript is dynamically/loosely typed language. Variable type nhi deni parti
Variable scope is in blocks
5 + 'k' will concatenate. Other operators wont work
undefined, null, NaN, boolean, string, number, Infinity
undefined: variable ka reference nhi bana hota e.g. let a
null: reference bann chuka hai but value nhi rakhi. let d = null
NaN: When something is not possible e.g. 0/0
typeof(varname)

comparision:

== loose, two values compared  0 == '0' will give true. It converted one value implicitly
=== strict, two values along with their types 0 === '0' will  give false.
Always use ===
