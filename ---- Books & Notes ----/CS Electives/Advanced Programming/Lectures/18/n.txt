To chane variable, we used state

When is state management difficult?


App
-Dashboard
    -User, signup
-Main
    -Cart, product details

Will have to change entire tree if user needs access in Cart.
Sholdnt send all dataa in query params

Redux:
    A global store that can be called by a component, but tareeqay se - thru a process
    Tracks who called.
    Component calls the process and the process fetches the part of state.
    Global variables.
    Javascript global variable can be called by anyone. difficult to track when error occurs
    React won't understand changes.

Component dispatches action (payload) reaches Reducer which accesses and updates the state.



redux.js 
-----------------

const redux = require('redux');
const toolkit = require('@reduxjs/toolkit');

const initialState={
    counter:0
}

//reducer
const reducer=(state=initialState, action)=>{
    if(action.type==='inc'){
        return{
            ...state,
            counter:state.counter+1
        }
    }
    if(action.type==='add'){
        return{
            ...state,
            counter:state.counter+action.value
        }
    }
    return state;
}

//store
const store = toolkit.configureStore({reducer:reducer});  // attach reducer because only it can access store
console.log(store.getState())

//dispatch action
store.dispatch({type:'inc'})
store.dispatch({type:'add', value:10}) // action is the object, value is the payload

console.log(store.getState())

//subscription
store.subscribe(()=>{
    console.log(store.getState())
})
