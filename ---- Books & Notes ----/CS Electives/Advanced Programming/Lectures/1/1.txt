Static pages: No interaction with user
Dynamic html pages: Takes user input
Single head and single body

img and br don't have closing Tags

anchor tag: for hyperlinks to redirect
    paths: absolute from scratch or relative

Block elements start from new line e.g. div, p

Inline elements continue in same line:e.g.bold, span, labels

class help differentiate elements help in styling

id helps getting values from code

presentational oriented approach

semantic: tags have meaningful names, content has meaning
    e.g. header, nav, content, article, section, aside (sidebar) footer, 
    strong (bold b), emphasis (italic i)
    article has sections

Styling: Inside head

closest style applied to the tag (inline nearer than the one in head)

parent child relationship: to not give style to some elements, h inside div

padding spacing inside border
margin spacing outside border
